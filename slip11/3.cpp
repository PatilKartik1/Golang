//ðŸ“Œ Observations on Input and Output
ðŸ”¹ Input Observations
IR Sensor Output: When an object is detected, the sensor outputs a HIGH signal.
Temperature Sensor Output: If the temperature crosses a threshold, it triggers an alert.
User Input: Manual button press can also control the buzzer.

ðŸ”¹ Output Observations
The buzzer turns ON and OFF every second.
The buzzer responds to the sensor input (IR detection or temperature change).
The system works until the program is manually stopped.

//ðŸ“Œ Result and Conclusion
ðŸ”¹ Result
Successfully interfaced Raspberry Pi / Arduino / BeagleBoard with an IR Sensor / Buzzer.
The buzzer turned ON and OFF as per the programmed logic.
The system responded correctly to sensor input.

ðŸ”¹ Conclusion
The experiment demonstrates GPIO programming for real-world applications.
Sensors and actuators can be easily controlled using embedded systems programming.
This is a fundamental concept for IoT, home automation, and robotics projects.
