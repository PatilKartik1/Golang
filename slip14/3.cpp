//C. Observations on Input and Output
Input Observations
The IR sensor detects an object and sends a signal to the board.
The microcontroller/microcomputer receives the sensor signal and processes it.
The buzzer turns ON when an object is detected or per the program logic.

Output Observations
The buzzer turns ON/OFF at a 1-second interval.
If the IR sensor is used, the buzzer activates when an object is detected.
If a temperature sensor is used, the buzzer triggers based on a threshold temperature.

//D. Result and Conclusion
Result
âœ… Successfully interfaced Raspberry Pi / BeagleBoard / Arduino with an IR Sensor and Buzzer.
âœ… The buzzer turned ON/OFF based on the programmed logic.

Conclusion
ðŸ”¹ This experiment demonstrates GPIO programming for embedded systems.
ðŸ”¹ It shows how to interface sensors and actuators with microcontrollers/microcomputers.
ðŸ”¹ This forms the foundation for IoT, automation, and robotics applications.
